      p.description Alice's Adventures in Wonderland is an 1865 novel written by English author 
        Charles Lutwidge Dodson under the pseudonym 
        Lewis Carroll. It tells of a girl named Alice falling through a rabbit hole into a fantasy 
        world populated by peculiar, anthropomorphic creates. The tale plays with logic, giving the 
        story lasting popularity with adults as well as children. It is considered to be one of the 
        best examples of the literary nonsense genre. Its narrative course and structure, characters and 
        imagery have been enormously influential in both popular culture and literature, especially 
        in the fantasy genre.
